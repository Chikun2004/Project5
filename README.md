# Project5
Oasis Infobyte Java Development 
# Digital Library Management:-
     The main objective of this project is to provide a complete automated Library by digitizing its
each and every functionality. Starting from the book-keeping, issuing of books, fine
generation, advance booking and report generation all will be accomplished under one single
project. The project will be a web based project with a database server responsible for
maintaining every single detail of the Library. It has a very user friendly interface which can
easily be operated by any non-technical person.



      There are essentially two modules of this software;



Admin module: Admin will have complete control over the system. Admin has permissions to
update, delete or modify any existing record or make a new entry (books and members). 



 Users: The normal users enjoy only limited privileges. They have a view access to the books.
They can browse through the categories, search for a particular book, return and issue a
book. They are also provided with an email option in case of a query.
